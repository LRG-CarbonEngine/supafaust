Minimum recommended CPU is a dual-core, dual-issue superscalar ARMv7 CPU with
NEON(e.g. Cortex A7), running at 900MHz for most SNES games, and at 1200MHz
for SuperFX, SA-1, and CX4 games.

Special chips supported: DSP-1, DSP-2, CX4, SuperFX, SA-1, S-DD1, MSU1

MSU1 support may have performance issues with runahead and/or state rewinding.

SPC playback is supported, to an extent.

Save states are not currently compatible across different architectures
(e.g. 32-bit ARM vs 64-bit ARM).

Save states are not currently sanitized properly on load, so don't load
save states from untrusted sources.

Core option changes take effect upon game load.

Setting "supafaust_frame_begin_vblank" to "disabled" will improve performance
but also increase input lag on most games.

Setting "supafaust_thread_affinity_emu" to "0x3" and
"supafaust_thread_affinity_ppu" to "0xc" may give better performance on a
quad-core CPU.

Setting "supafaust_renderer" to "st", to disable multithreaded PPU rendering,
may improve performance on systems with only a single CPU with a single core.

Official builds are compiled with Debian Stretch GCC 6.x toolchains.
